# iEEG Backend - GSoC 2026

Welcome! This repository houses the core multiprocessing backend for the intracranial EEG (iEEG) visualization and machine learning suite. 

## 📂 Project Architecture

The codebase strictly adheres to OOP and SOLID principles to guarantee maintainability and seamless GUI integration:

## 🚀 Current Implementation Status

At this initial phase of the GSoC timeline, we have successfully implemented and verified the foundational **Data Ingestion Engine**.

- **`src/core/data_manager.py`**: A robust OOP wrapper natively reading massive multi-GB `.edf` files using memory pointers (via `mne.io.read_raw(preload=False)`). Includes rigorous validation mapping exact neural channels (`eeg`, `seeg`, `ecog`) safely using `mne.pick_types`, preventing runtime failures from inconsistent hospital naming schemes. It leverages a Python Context Manager to lock/unlock OS file handles.
- **`src/core/sliding_window.py`**: A pure Python Generator that ingests the `DataManager` stream and mathematically slices it into $O(1)$ memory chunks using configurable offsets. It seamlessly eliminates arbitrary end-of-file truncation branching by dynamically calculating duration limits.
- **The Pipeline**: Together, the `DataManager` pulls metadata and passes it to the `SlidingWindowGenerator`, which precisely invokes `get_window()` to stream isolated arrays from the disk *only* when the memory loop yields.

*(Extensible: Sections detailing the ABC plugin contracts, PyTorch models, and async bridge will be populated as the registry and UI integration layers are finalized.)*

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Results

The data ingestion pipeline has been subjected to extreme edge-case validation and clinical memory profiling. 

- **Unit Tests (100% Coverage)**: The modules pass `pytest` with a seamless **100% coverage** over the core modules. The dynamic assertions rigorously lock down zero-length windows, negative overlap parameters, out-of-bounds duration requests, and fractional end-of-file truncation rounding.
- **1.2GB Clinical Stress Test**: The pipeline executed a continuous MProf heartbeat trace over a massive, real 1.2GB clinical `.edf` file, simulating chunks scaling up to 172 simultaneous data channels.
- **RAM Resilience**: Memory usage proved entirely resilient. The RAM consumption idled strictly at a `~147 MB` baseline. During disk-read bursts, memory spiked proportionately but immediately compressed back down to exactly `147 MB` via aggressive garbage collection (`gc.collect()`), permanently neutralizing the risk of cumulative memory overflow regardless of recording length.
